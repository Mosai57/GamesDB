|| Games Database Access Tool ||
\\============================//

GDB Access is a tool used to log and keep track of one's
game library across many platforms and formats.

Adding a game is as simple as filling out the Game Name, System, and Format
fields and hitting add.

Searching the database is very flexible, and the search engine supports SQL like
wildcards (%), or even just blank fields will act as wildcards.

Before using the GDB Access tool, be sure to run the SetupDB script included with the
application, as that will create a clean database for you to use, or  will even  completely 
wipe your old database.
